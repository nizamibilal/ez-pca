Principal Component Analysis of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories

Program under development...

### TODO list:
- [X] Read binary trajectory file
- [X] Build covariance matrix of Cartesian coordinates
- [X] Matrix diagonalization
- [ ] Organize the program for easier maintainance
- [ ] Apply proper algorithm to fit each frame to a reference (or average) structure 
- [ ] Include more information in the output data file besides eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
